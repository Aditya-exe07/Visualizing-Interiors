## Description

**Visualizing Interiors** is an iOS app that allows users to design and preview room layouts using Augmented Reality (AR). Users can select a room type (like bedroom, kitchen, study, etc.) and place virtual furniture in their physical space through their device's camera.

The app includes a basic user registration system using Core Data, ensuring a personalized experience. The app lays the foundation for future expansion into persistent and shareable design sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**
- **Xcode**
- **ARKit** – for placing 3D furniture models in AR
- **RealityKit** – for rendering 3D content
- **Core Data** – used for user registration
- **SwiftUI** – for the user interface

## Features

- Room selection: bedroom, living room, kitchen, study room, etc.
- Real-time furniture placement in AR using ARKit
- Basic user registration with Core Data
- Clean and intuitive SwiftUI-based UI

## How It Works (see demo)

1. Register and log in to the app.
2. Choose a room type.
3. Use your camera to enter AR view.
4. Tap on items to place them within the room.
5. Move them around to visualize different arrangements.
